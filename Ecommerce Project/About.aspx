            I was born in Orange City, Iowa and have lived here a large part of my life.
            I had the opportunity to live overseas, in both Germany and Southeast Asia.
            I enjoy sport shooting and traveling, in addition to riding my motorcycle.

        <p>
            I grew up on a small acreage in Northwest Iowa near the town of Sioux Center where I still call home to this day. 
            Growing up I enjoyed spending time outdoors hunting and fishing. I have always enjoyed shooting guns and own a few myself. 
            Some other hobbies I enjoy doing whenever I get the chance are riding motorcycle, playing racquetball, and occasionally flying radio controlled airplanes.
